# UI Sound Design
## HaikuOS

UI sound design is a topic which has interested me greatly over the past few months. I distinctly remember an avid lecturer at UoE who was a big advocate for UI design, especially in software and games. This inherent excitement over sound as accessibility was quite contagious. Therefore, when I stumbled across Haiku (a fantastic operating system (OS) currently in beta I originally found looking for a new OS daily driver during lockdown) and their community system sounds competition. I decided (very unusually for me) to take the plunge and create a sound kit specifically designed for UI.

## The Prompt
>All sound effects except the startup chime should be up to 1 second long. If the situation calls for, it can be longer, but it should **not** exceed 2 seconds. For startup chime, the limit is 5 seconds.
All sound effects should be non-intrusive. Distorted tunes, high-pitched tunes will not be considered.
Expanding on “haiku” and related themes are encouraged.
Entries need to be in uncompressed PCM format.

>As R1 steadily approaches, we are looking for contestants (amateur, professional, enthusiast) to produce system sound effects for Haiku. Specifically sounds for:
>
>General:
>
Beep
A nice and soothing startup chime
Notifications:
>
Information notification
Important notification
Error notification
Progress notification (= the percentage of the progress bar gets updated)
Key/mouse events:
>
Key down
Key repeat
Key up
Keymap switch
Mouse down
Mouse up
Window events:
>
Window activated (= gets focus)
Window close
Window minimised (= window tab gets double-clicked to hide the window)
Window open
Window restored (= gets ‘unminimised’)
Window zoomed (= when ‘zoom’ button (right widget in tab) is clicked)

Seems simple, no? Well I am here to say that it was not. Convincing, coherent and accessible UI sound design is a difficult fish to fry. Furthermore, the current sonic landscape of computer operating systems is saturated with ubiquity; think of macs. Yup. You just vocalised the start-up sound didn't you? 

## The Start-up Sound
As per usual, the biggest beast to tackle should be tackled first. Coming from a western-classical-tradition-turned-electronic-experimentalist perspective I booted up Reason 10 and loaded my favourite synth of all time (for now): *Europa*. I have a very special place in my heart for this synth, it got me through my master's dissertation and provoked me to think of composition on a vertical axis, rather than horizontal. The thoughts of evolutionary drones whetted my appetite and I got to work, only to remember the start-up chime was limited to a maximum of five seconds. In my quest for drones, I can tell you I got no-where near five seconds. 
I did manage, however, to come up with the basis of *something*. It certainly could have become a start-up sound, but I went in a completely different, unforeseen, direction.  
Here's take one of the synthetic drone start-up:

### Phase 1
 In my mind (bare in mind that this is a pre-first-draft render) this slant on the start-up sound conjures immediate associations with the aforementioned Mac sound. It has a lot more movement in it, thanks to flanging and phaser-ing, following a very sine wave-esque trajectory. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. To be honest, this was headed in the wrong direction: far too much movement within the sound; utilising a pad with such a long attack would only end up being cut short in post; it seems a little *too* synthetic for 'Haiku'. Let's face it, I quit whilst I was ahead. I gave Leonie a listen and her feedback was the final (and to be honest the first) nail in the coffin. Cutting a long conversation short, her premise centred on the pad's decay. 
 >"Why should a start-up sound trail off? Shouldn't it be more of a fanfare?"

More true words have yet to be spoken. This resulted in a complete 'back to the drawing board' kind of moment. I loathed the idea of getting more *classical* in the sound design. I wanted to put my year of electronic experimentation at university continue into the next project. Try as I might, I could not shape a sound I was happy with utilising the synthesisers at my disposal.

 
### Phase 2
 My compositional method has changed from looking horizontally (temporal domain), to vertically (frequency domain), and I tend to start with the bass bands and then build upon it. Usually I start by trying out different chord structures with a piano.
